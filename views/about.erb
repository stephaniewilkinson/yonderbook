<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">What Yonderbook Does</h2>
<p>Yonderbook bridges the gap between the books you want to read and the free books already available to you.</p>

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">Features:</h3>

<p><strong>Goodreads to Libby</strong><br>
Copy books from your Goodreads lists and add them directly to your Libby app. Instead of endlessly scrolling through Libby, find exactly what you've already decided you want to read. Perfect for when you want to read on your phone or tablet and already have a curated to-read list ready to go.</p>

<p><strong>Goodreads to BookMooch</strong><br>
Copy books from your Goodreads lists to your BookMooch wishlist. The best books on BookMooch get snatched up quickly, but by adding them to your wishlist, you'll get an email the moment they're available - so you can be the first to mooch them and get those books in the mail.</p>

<p><strong>Analyze Your Reading</strong><br>
See your reading patterns by author gender, publication date, and your rating distribution as a histogram. Discover if you're stuck in your comfort zone or if you're the diverse reader you think you are. Are you a harsh critic or do you love everything you read?</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">Why I Built Yonderbook</h2>
<p>I'm an avid reader with over 1,200 books on my Goodreads to-read shelf. (Yes, I know that's ridiculous. No, I'm not going to stop adding more.)</p>

<p>I was tired of manually checking if each book on my massive want-to-read list was available at my library - a soul-crushing task that took hours. I knew the library probably had many of them, but finding out which ones meant copying and pasting hundreds of titles one by one.</p>

<p>So I built a tool to solve my own problem. When I posted online asking if others would want this, I got a resounding YES from fellow book-hoarders who were drowning in their TBR lists too.</p>

<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8">The Problem We're Solving</h2>
<p>Every reader knows these frustrations:</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 ml-4">
    <li>You have hundreds of books on your want-to-read list but no easy way to get them</li>
    <li>The library has some of them, but checking each one manually? That's your whole Saturday gone</li>
    <li>You end up buying books that were free at your library the whole time</li>
    <li>BookMooch has books you want, but you miss them because you didn't know they became available</li>
</ul>

<p>Yonderbook eliminates that friction. You'll easily know which of your thousands of TBR books are available right now, for free.</p>
