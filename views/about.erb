        <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
          <p>I'm an avid reader with over 1,200 books on my Goodreads to-read shelf.</p>

          <p>I was tired of manually checking if each book on my massive want-to-read list was available at my library. I knew the library probably had many of them, but finding out which ones meant copying and pasting titles one by one.</p>

          <p>So I built a tool to solve my own problem. When I posted online asking if others would want this, I got a resounding YES from fellow book-hoarders who were drowning in their TBR lists too.</p>

      <div>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">Every reader knows these frustrations:</p>
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-gray-600">
          <li>• You have hundreds of books on your want-to-read list but no easy way to get them</li>
          <li>• The library has some of them, but checking each one manually? That's your whole Saturday gone</li>
          <li>• You end up buying books that were free at your library the whole time</li>
          <li>• BookMooch has books you want, but you miss them because you didn't know they became available</li>
          <li>• Yonderbook eliminates that friction. You'll easily know which of your thousands of TBR books are available right now, for free.</li>
