# Yonderbook Technical TODO

## Project Vision
Transform Yonderbook into an "Own Your Book Data" platform that aggregates reading data across all platforms (Kindle, Goodreads, Libby, Audible, etc.)

**Current Status**:
- 586 active users (last 12 months)
- Goodreads import: FIXED âœ…
- BookMooch integration: Working
- Libby integration: Working
- No database currently (stateless)
- No user emails/auth

## Phase 1: Database & Auth Foundation

  ```sql
  -- Users table
  -- Books table (store aggregated data)
  -- User_books junction table
  -- Sources table (where each book came from)
  -- Import_jobs table (track import status)
  -- Bookclubs table (future feature)
  -- Club_members junction table
  -- Club_books table
  ```

## Notes for Claude Code

When implementing features:
- Keep existing stateless functionality as fallback
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- All imports should handle malformed data gracefully
- Consider rate limiting for expensive operations
- Background jobs for data imports using Supabase Edge Functions
- Cache external API calls aggressively
- Use database transactions for multi-table operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Follow RESTful conventions for API endpoints
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Implement proper logging at all levels
- Consider mobile-first for all new features
