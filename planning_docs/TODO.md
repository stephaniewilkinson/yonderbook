## Notes for Claude Code

When implementing features:
- Keep existing stateless functionality as fallback
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- All imports should handle malformed data gracefully
- Consider rate limiting for expensive operations
- Background jobs for data imports using Supabase Edge Functions
- Cache external API calls aggressively
- Use database transactions for multi-table operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Follow RESTful conventions for API endpoints
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Implement proper logging at all levels
- Consider mobile-first for all new features
